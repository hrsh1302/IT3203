        <div class="section">
            <p>Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web (WWW). 
            In 1989, while working at CERN, he proposed a system for sharing information using hypertext, which led to the creation of the first web browser and web server.</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "The Web is more a social creation than a technical one. I designed it for a social effect—to help people work together—and not as a technical toy."

            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>Born in 1955 in London, Berners-Lee studied physics at the University of Oxford. 
            His interest in computing grew during his studies, leading him to develop early software systems.</p>

            <h2>Invention of the Web</h2>
            <p>While at CERN, Berners-Lee developed HTML, HTTP, and the first web browser, launching the first website in 1991. 
            His work revolutionized the way people access and share information globally.</p>

            <h2>Later Contributions</h2>
            <p>Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to develop web standards and continues to advocate for an open and accessible internet.</p>
